     <ul>
       <li><p>Client Name: Birgitte Heggstad</p></li>
       <li><p>Position: Owner of the kennel </p></li>
     </ul>
     <p>“Teigestova” is a newly established dog kennel which primary function is line breeding of dogs.
        Our client is the owner of the kennel, Birgitte Heggstad. Heggstad is the mother of one of our group members.
        The client was already looking into getting a website, and we were in contact with her from early on.
        After discussing the scope of the website with Heggstad, and the timing of when it needed to be done,
        we came in agreement that this would be a suitable website for our project.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="purpose" class="paragraph">
      <h2>Website's Purpose</h2>
      <p>The client’s aim with the website is to have a place to gather all the necessary information about her dogs and newly established kennel. She believes this is essential as starting next year, one of her show dogs will produce a litter of purebred dogs, of the breed “Bichon Havanais”, whom will need new homes. Through this website potential future dog owners will be able to read about the client’s dogs and puppies as well as getting the necessary information about the breed and kennel. Birgitte also wants the site to be informative to friends and family as well.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="goals" class="paragraph">
      <h2>Website's Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Get potential dog owners interested in Bichon Havanais puppies to contact
            Birgitte Heggstad with the intent of buying a puppy (primary goal).</p></li>
        <li><p>Convince potential dog owners for whom Bichon Havanais is a suitable breed that these particular puppies
            are right for them (secondary goal).</p></li>
        <li><p>Build a social and professional network among other Havanais dog breeders in order to create sufficient
            trust for other Bichon Havanais breeders to be interested in buying a dog in the future.</p></li>
        <li><p>Keep friends and family up to date with the dog breeding related activities of Heggstad.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="audience" class="paragraph">
        <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
        <p>The client has identified three target audiences she feels the website should be suited for:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>Potential buyers</li>
            <li>Friends and family</li>
            <li>Dog breeders</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Discussing this, we came to the conclusion that the audience which our client had in mind,
          most likely covers the majority of users whom the site should be targeted towards.
          The primary audience of the website will be users intending to buy a new puppy.
          We therefore intend to build the website with this group in focus. Friends, family and the community
          are audiences which might find some use with the website, but they are not specifically the target audience.</p>

    <section>
       <h3 id="home">Home</h3>
         <p>The front page is the landing site and it is important that it creates a good first impression.
          We want the user to feel welcome and make the business seem legitimate and trustworthy. The design
          will be modern, professional and clean. It will include pictures and relevant information for the
          target audience. From the front page the user should be able to navigate easily and find the right
          information. We will not make the page too fancy because we expect the computer skills of the users
          will vary a lot.</p>

      <h3 id="about">About Us</h3>
        <p>In this section we want to include information about Teigestova and the business in general. We also
          want to showcase that the breeding process meets the standards and ethical guidelines of the kennel community.
          Buying a dog is a big financial and personal decision and we expect potential buyers will want to know about the
          business before making a decision. By adding this section and providing the user with crucial information we expect
          to establish trust and legitimacy. We want to keep this page clean and easy to read and the focus should be on the
          text although we might include other elements.</p>

     <h3 id="dogs">Our Dogs</h3>
        <p>This section will include information about the client’s dogs. Not the one for sale, but rather the ones used
          in the breeding process. The purpose of this section is to give the users insight in the breeding process and
          show where the puppies come from.</p>

    <h3 id="puppies">Puppies</h3>
        <p>The second one will present the puppies for sale. In this subsection the user can get a closer look at the puppies
          and find relevant information about them. For potential buyers this page must have a strong appeal and hopefully
          make the user feel attached to the dogs. The focus should be on the puppies and we will not add more elements than
          necessary. Adding too many pictures can make the page run slowly and finding the right balance between performance
          and content will be important in this section.</p>

    <h3 id="havanese">Bichon Havanese</h3>
        <p>This section has two subsections. The first one will consist of general information about the breed and show the
          user what characteristics to expect from it.</p>

    <h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>
        <p>Frequently Asked Questions. Puppies are expensive and a significant financial and personal investment. Buyers
          typically spend a lot of time doing research. Making information easily available is therefore a priority and this
          section will highlight some of the most common questions and hopefully make the process easier. It should be clean
          and consist of mainly text as well as some links to external sites if necessary. We do not want to take the focus
          away from the text by adding other elements to the page.</p>

    <h3 id="contact">Contact</h3>
        <p>Contact information such as e-mail, phone number and address will be added here. In case the users have questions
          or want to make an offer they can easily find the needed information in this section. We will also include links to
          social media sites.</p>

    <h3 id="foot">Footer</h3>
        <p>Every page will have a footer that will include relevant information.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="location" class="paragraph">
      <h2>Final Location</h2>
      <p>No final location has been discussed, but as the client lacks any previous experience with hosting a website, we
        recommended her to use a web hosting service for this purpose.</p>
