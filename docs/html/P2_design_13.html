          <h2>Website's Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
          <p>The client’s aim with the website is to have a place to gather all the necessary information about her dogs and newly established kennel. She believes this is essential as starting next year, one of her show dogs will produce a litter of purebred dogs, of the breed “Bichon Havanais”, whom will need new homes. Through this website potential future dog owners will be able to read about the client’s dogs and puppies as well as getting the necessary information about the breed and kennel. This will leave a positive impression on buyers which will influence their decision when choosing who they want to buy their dog from. Birgitte also wants the site to be informative to friends and family as well.</p>

        <section id="navigation" class="paragraph">
            <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
            <p>
                Teigestova’s website has to be easy to navigate through as the primary function is to catch the interest of potential buyers whom most likely aren’t tech-savvy. We want the user to be able to reach every category-page, of particular relevance to a potential buyer, from the front page. The user should be able to reach every page in a category from this landing page. In practice, this means that every page on the website should be reached within two-three clicks. Every page will be available from the main page when using the drop-down navigation bar.

                By structuring the page this way, the user will be able to easily access the content of most interest while still receiving information about the general content on the page. The main page will inform the user about categories such as “Om Teigestova” and “Våre hunder”. When redirected to those categories, they will be able to access every webpage connected to the category. The user could also use the navigation bare if they want to immediately access a specific page.

                Figure 1 shows the navigation structure without the use of the navigation bar. We’ve not included a figure with the navigation bar, because every subpage is available at all times. This is because the navigation bar will follow on every page. It would therefore appear too cluttered if we were to draw lines between each seperate html file we intend to use..

        <section id="layout" class="paragraph">
          <h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
          <p></p>
        </section>

        <section id="content" class="paragraph">
            <h2>Content</h2>
                <h3>Home</h3>
                <p>
                    The home page will be the users first impression of the website. The purpose is to make the user feel welcome and to make Teigestova appear professional. The design will be clean and we want the user to be able to navigate and find the desired information without any hassle.

                    At the top of the front page we will have a large and high-quality picture of the dog(s). Under the picture and at the bottom of the browser window we will include the navigation bar. As the user scrolls down the bar will move towards the top and stay there. This feature will be implemented by using Java script. As the user is scrolling down we will include more.

                    We want there to be more than just a picture and a navigation bar at the front page although we do not want to overwhelm the user with text and information. As the user scrolls down there will be three different stories and a picture. The first story will have text on the left side and the picture on the right. The next story will have text on the right side and a picture on the left and the last will have text on the left side and a picture on the right side. By doing this we create a more natural transition and distinguish between the stories that will be highlighted in the home page.
                </p>
                
                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>
                    This section will inform the users of what Teigestova is and give general information about its business. It will follow the universal layout of the site and consist of text and pictures. The purpose is to make the information easily accessible and we will not include unnecessary design features that can distract the user.
                    
                    Instead of having a wall of text we will divide it into paragraphs and sub-sections. The pictures will be positioned to the right or between sub-sections. The navigation bar will always be present at the top of the browser window. It will stay there when the user is scrolling down to make it easy to navigate to other sections of the website.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Our Dogs</h3>
                <p>
                    This will be a more in-depth page of the dogs used in the breeding process and not the ones for sale. It is important to portray them in a good way as they will give the user an impression of what the puppies will be and look like. The purpose is to portray the dogs in a good way so that the user will be interested in buying one of their puppies.
                    
                    The page will have a sub-section for each of the dogs where we will include pictures, text and a “fact box”. We will start each section with a picture at the top followed by a short introduction including the fact box. AS the user scrolls down we will include a more detailed description and text as well as including more pictures.
                    
                    The fact box will have information about color, height, length etc.
                    
                    The navigation bar will constantly stay at the top of the browser window.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Puppies</h3>
                <p>
                    This will be the section about the puppies. The goal is to make the user interested and ideally want to buy one of the puppies.  
                    We want each puppy to be presented in an own paragraph that will consist of basic facts, an introduction and a picture. The picture will be positioned to the right of the text and facts.

                    We want to include a lot of pictures in this section. Having them all appear simultaneously would make the page unnecessarily long. Instead we will implement a slideshow feature. When the user opens the slide-show it will “elevate” a bit from the page and highlight the picture. The rest of the page will be blurred out to make the picture in focus. The user can then scroll from picture to picture using the next buttons and end the slideshow by clicking anywhere on the blurred-out part of the page. The navigation bar will constantly stay at the top of the browser window. Other than that the page will follow the universal layout of the website.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Bichon havanais</h3>
                <p>
                    In this section we will introduce the user to Bichon Havanais. It will include information about the breed, advantages/disadvantages, who the dog is fit for and other general information. The purpose is to give the user a good indication as to what it is like to own a Bichon

                    The page will be divided into paragraphs and sub-sections.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Activities and awards</h3>
                <p>
                This section will highlight the awards and activities of the dogs used in the breeding process. The achievements of the dogs is of importance to potential buyers as it is a good indication of what the puppies might be like.
                
                This section will include pictures from dog shows and other activities.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Contact</h3>
                <p>
                    The contact section will include contact information such as e-mail, phone number, address and links to social media. The purpose is to make it easy for users to contact Teigestove in case they want more information. The design will be clean, and it will consist of mainly text with description on how to contact Teigestova. The email address will be an e-mail link and the social media links will appear as icons instead of a long URL. The navigation bar will stick to the top of the browser window.
                </p>

            <p>
                The table below shows all of our html, css and script files as well as who is in charge of producing and maintaining said files. We've decided to split the scripts between four members in the group and the last one will make sure the CSS file works as intended upon final delivary. We believe we have split the workload evenly among all group members. The individuals responsible for a file won't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, but they are responsible for making sure that the task is completed on the due date. We intend to be done with everything by monday the fifth of november, leaving us with a week of testing, proofreading and making any potential last minute changes if necessary.
