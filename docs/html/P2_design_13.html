          <h2>Website's Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
          <p>The client’s aim with the website is to have a place to gather all the necessary information about her dogs and newly established kennel. She believes this is essential as starting next year, one of her show dogs will produce a litter of purebred dogs, of the breed “Bichon Havanais”, whom will need new homes. Through this website potential future dog owners will be able to read about the client’s dogs and puppies as well as getting the necessary information about the breed and kennel. This will leave a positive impression on buyers which will influence their decision when choosing who they want to buy their dog from. Birgitte also wants the site to be informative to friends and family as well.</p>
