       <h2>Changes we have made</h2>
    <h3>Changes to teigestova.html</h3>
        <p>We initially wanted the landing page to be a relatively long page the user could scroll through to get an overview of what Teigestova is and what information the user can get on the website. This proved to be a bit more difficult than expected since we're not allowed to use features like flex and grid, which makes it a lot harder to properly style the layout of such a page. Because of this, a section where we had planned to use a black/white background image with a text that had a concave border, was not styled accordingly. Other than that the overall length of the webpage was  shortened, not ever section has 100% screen height.</p>
    <h3>Changes to imageView.js</h3>
        <p>The feature does what we wanted it to do. The way it does it isn't necessarily what we wanted though. The lightbox proved to be a difficult task and methods found on websites such as w3schools either used tools we were not allowed to use in the project, or they repeated lines directly in the html. We worked around this by taking the principle of repeating html code, but doing it by manipulating the DOM through javascript.</p>
    <h3>Changes to contact.html</h3>
        <p>We originally planned to have a simple contact form on the contact page, and implemented this. However, the feedback we got from testers closest to our target groups (please see P4 for further refence), was that they would rather use e-mail or telephone as correspondence – and that having a form on the page actually heightened the threshold for contact. After checking whether our client wanted to keep the form (as the form might give the possibility to structure information in a certain way), we decided to delete the form and the simple JavaScript function accompanying it. We then decided to move the contact information to the place where the form had been, and to broaden the Google Maps embedment. </p>
    <h3>Changes to ourDogsPuppies.html</h3>
        <p>Due to there not being any puppies at the moment, the page was changed to be more of a placeholder until there are actual puppies to show and promote.</p>
