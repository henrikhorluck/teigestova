    <br>
    <p>We have tested our website in two ways. Firstly, we have disseminated a Google Form together with a link to our website, and secondly, we have conducted live testing with three users. We have chosen to explain the method, audience and result of the two different test strategies in different chapters of this page, because the two test settings are very different. In the live testing, the conversation was lead by the user and observations, whereas the survey is lead by our own constrained boxes. The test design in itself, and the differences in audience proximity to our target group, call for different sections. </p>
    <h3>Test design</h2>
    <p>The link to the survey: https://goo.gl/forms/WtHJAt1yi3fEtJw33
        We have sent a Google form to several testers. The form consists of four parts. In the first part, we ask the testers to provide information such as what device and browser they are using. The second part is about the design and first impression. Thirdly, we try to find out how easy it was for the testers to navigate, and in the last section we collect feedback and errors the testers have found.
        
        We believe the test will give us valuable insight and reveal mistakes or errors that we might have missed during our own testing. We have tried to cover as many aspects of our page as possible without making it too long and dreadful.
        </p>
    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>We have tried to find testers that reflects the target audience of the website. Our target audience is broad as it consists of anyone interested in buying a dog. It can be any age group and most demographics fit the description. We wanted to find different age groups as we know that the online literacy of elderly people may be lower than that of the younger. Collecting test results from different age groups and seeing how they respond to the website is therefore important.

        To find the right target audience we have sent the form to people we believe fit the description. We think we have been partly successful in collecting results from different parts of our target audience. About 70% of the testers are 30 years or younger. 15 % are between 31 and 50 and 15% are older than 51. It is not the perfect spread, but we got responses from all the age groups.
        
        Summary and highlights of Google form input 
        We have received a lot of valuable responses. The feedback on the design was both positive and negative. 
    </p>

    <h3>Testing platforms</h3>
      <p>The website was tested mainly on laptops, with both macOS and Windows. With Google Chrome and Safari on macOS, and Chrome and Firefox on Windows. We tested on mobiles as well, with a majority of iPhones, but one test-participant answered he/she used Android and Safari, which doesn't make sense.</p>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>The testers were mostly satisfied but not excited about the design. Most notably the feedback on our background which many testers thought was boring or bland. Testers thought the design was simple and it does not steal the focus away from the content too much. The design improves the quality of the website and when asked whether they thought it appeared as a serious website or not they were generally leaning towards serious.
        We also received some feedback on the font and font size. Some testers thought it was too big and uninteresting. Other than that, they seemed pleased with the design and many thought it had a professional look. In the design section we also asked testers about their first impression as we believe that is a crucial part of any website. The responses were mainly positive, and their first impressions were that the site seems professional and cool.
    </p>
    <h3>Usability</h3>
    The testers were generally very positive about the navigation part. They thought it was easy to use, and they found the information they were looking for without any hassle. However, some testers encountered some errors with the navigation bar. Specifically, the drop-down menu which appeared behind some images. Other than that, testers seemed pleased about the navigation. On a scale from 1-6 nearly everyone responded with 5 and 6 on the navigation questions.
We then asked the testers how well they thought the website had worked on their device on a scale from 1-6. We wanted to get an overall score and the responses ranged from 3-6. The average was about 4.5. 
    <h3>Specific suggestions</h3>
    <p>We also asked what they think would improve the website. The responses were mainly related to the design and navigation bar. Some testers noticed that not all pages were 100% responsive and because of that the pictures appeared wrong. The drop-down bar was also covered by other images at some point. Some also commented about the design which they thought seemed a bit bland and the font that the font was too big. Other than that, the testers seemed positive and did not find anything specific that they felt were missing.  
      </p>

      <h2>LIVE TESTS</h2>
      <h3>Test design</h3>
      <p>With regards to the live testing, we tried our best to find users matching the target group of the website. The testing was carried out in the following way: 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>We showed the users the website, and encouraged them to “live comment” their impressions, experiences along the way. As the users to some degree matched the target group personas, we wanted their first experience with the page to be as organic as possible, and noticed what kind of pages they were interested to look at, and what purpose they intuitively thought the page had. </li>
          <li>We then gave the users some simple tasks, namely: 
              – Find out whether this breed has an activity level that suits your life. 
              – Find out what kind of activities the dogs have participated in. 
              – Find the contact information of the breeder.</li>
          <li>Next, we showed the users a mobile version of the page and asked them to “live comment” their first experience with the page on this platform, and then to carry out the tasks written above. </li>
          <li>Lastly, we discussed the page more openly with the users. What were their impression of the website? What kind of impression did they have of the site’s purpose? To what extent did they think that Teigestova is a professional breeder? What would be the next step if they wanted to learn more about Teigestova? </li>
        </ol>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The testers matched our personas to some extent. Live tester 1, let’s call her Ellen, is 56 years old, her kids have just moved out, and she has never before owned a dog. Live tester 2, let’s call him Mikkel, is 33 years old, and has previously owned a range of dogs. Live tester 3 is our client herself. 
        </p>
      <h3>Summary and highlights from the live testing</h3>
      <p><strong>Useability:</strong>When trying to conduct the tasks we gave, the users found the information about the activity level of the breed and the contact information of Teigestova on their first try. The users mastered the navigation intuitively. Our client said she thought the page was very orderly, and that it was easy to navigate back and forth. However, when he visited certain pages, Mikkel couldn’t click “Activities”. Moreover, Mikkel said that he didn’t expect that he could open the landing page “Our dogs” from the menu. Ellen also – of course – had problems opening the “Activities” page from the navbar on some pages, and, when they managed to click it, it turned out that the “activity” page didn’t work, it was a 404. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Contact:</strong> Both Ellen and Mikkel unprovokedly commented on the form on the front page and on contact.html. Mikkel noted that “ah, a form, that’s annoying. I feel that people never answer when you try to contact them with a form. And if I am only to submit my phone number, can I then be called during the workday? Shouldn’t I be in control of this?”. Ellen noted that “I wouldn’t have used this form if I wanted to contact Teigestova. It seems too formal and impersonal. Am I allowed to send an e-mail instead? I guess they wouldn’t like that because the form is there..”. As the “final conversion” of the whole website is to get visitors to contact Teigestova, we discussed whether we should delete the form. We then asked our client whether having a form on the page would actually give her any benefits, and she said no. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Design</strong> Both Ellen and Mikkel seemed to appreciate the pictures, both of the dogs and the owner. They said that the client (of which we have an image on the contact page) seemed very nice and approachable, and that this impression would have made it easier to contact her. Mikkel said that the margins of the information was not the same on every page, and that it looked a bit messy when the text sometimes went from one end of the desktop to the other. 
        Mikkel said he liked the logo design, and that you could see the fur of the actual dogs through it. Our client said the logo was “lekker”. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Content:</strong> The purpose of the website seemed to be very clear to all the live-testers: this is a dog breeder planning to sell puppies. Still, they noted that the page gave them valuable information and “didn’t just try to sell” (as Ellen said it). Both Ellen and Mikkel said that they found the extent of information to be sufficient. “It is very easy to imagine how it is to own such a dog”, Mikkel said. He also said (unprovoked) that he really wanted a havanais puppy after looking at the page.</p>

        <p>Our client was generally pleased with the content, but said that she would have liked it to be easier to access the litter plans from the frontpage, perhaps a button where a user could access the site “valper” right away. Also, she would have liked to have more information about the pedigree of the dogs that were to be bred. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Overall impression:</strong> Although all live testers noted that some pages didn’t work well (especially not on a mobile device, and they found one 404), they had the impression that the people behind Teigestova are serious and really knows what they are doing.</p>
        <p>
          The main comments from our client was that she was very impressed about the design, navigation and useability of the page. Because we were very happy with the following quote from our client, we have kept it in its original language, Norwegian: “Nå er jo jeg mye inne på andre sine hjemmesider og jeg må si at dette blir landets beste Havanais-side. Mitt mål da jeg møtte dere i september, var å få en hjemmeside som potensielle valpekjøpere vil huske i jungelen av kennel sider. Målet er oppnådd!”</p>


      
     <h3>Our response</h3>
     <dl>
       <dt><strong>Old-feeling Design</strong></dt>
       <dd>There were several responses regarding the design 'feeling' old, but those were from a younger audience that those we are aiming for, and therefore feel that the design is appropiate. After the class we could also change the design to be "fancier" or more animated and so on, but we do not have time to do changes like that right now.</dd>
       <dt><strong>Other design wishes</strong></dt>
       <dd>There were other design-issues regarding things like boring fonts and irresponsive images. We have a prototype with changed fonts, and will try to incorporate as soon as possible. The images not working is also a CSS-issue and should be fixed. A lot of the design issues have come from us having many different forms of css and issues related to merging them, and thus it would make sense to do a complete CSS-makeover 💅, which will happen, eventually.</dd>
       <dt><strong>Issues</strong></dt>
       <dd>We got clear indications on pages that didn’t work, and fixed this immediately.</dd>
       <dt><strong>Slow loading</strong></dt>
       <dd>The was one response complaining about slow loading, which we can fix partly by making sure only the appropiate size image is downloaded, or compress the images, but it might also be an issue related to folk.ntnu, which would make it far harder to fix.</dd>
       <dt><strong>Minor usability</strong></dt>
       <dd>Making the anchor tags more clear that they are clickable should be fixed with something like `a {text-decoration: underline;}`, but then we need to make sure that matches with our current design. </dd>
       <dt><strong>Link to ourDogsParent instead of image view on teigestova.html</strong></dt>
       <dd>While that would probably make more sense in terms of website design, imageView.js is a part of the javascript requirement on this project, but could be moved and implemented on for example ourDogsPuppies.html once the project is finished and we have actual puppies to promote.</dd>
       <dt><strong>Contact form</strong></dt>
       <dd>We decided to delete the contact form. Although we thought the site looked prettier with it, we concluded that functionality was the most important issue here: making it easier for the client to reach her final goal of contact with prospective buyers.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Litter plans</strong></dt>
        <dd>Our client came with a very important point about the accessibility and visibility of the litter plans. This is crucial information for potential buyers. However, we have decided not to implement the proposed changes as a part of this project as we did not have the time to do this thoroughly. This will be implemented after the project period is over.</dd>

     <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
     <h3>Hedvig</h3>
     <p> During this project, we have learnt a lot about cooperating offline and online. Some groupware systems worked well from the get-go and will definitely be used in other projects (Slack), others, we have struggled with – and understand that we should create project specific guidelines for how these should be used. These are some of the key learning take-aways from this project (outside of HTML, CSS and JavaScript):</p>

     <p><strong>Lost in merging.</strong> Unfortunately, not everyone were able to go to a Git course or grasp the functionality well enough, and this lead to some difficulties. Firstly, everybody worked internally on their CSS document for a long amount of time without uploading it to git and see how the documents worked together. We first merged our five separate CSS documents five days before the P3 and P4 deadline. This lead to merge conflicts, and the group’s most Git proficient members had a hard time merging the documents. In the effort, several lines of styling disappeared, and the css code some of the less css-skilled group members had worked hard to deploy. As a consequence, the same styling had to be implemented again by the responsible for the main CSS document, and some group members lost some of their motivation to style their respective pages.</p> 

     <p><strong>Lost in translation.</strong> There were also some issues with understandment. This has been a multi-disciplinary working group with different perspectives on the importance of different elements, different cooperation styles, and different use of expressions. We did not always understand each other – and, more importantly – we did not always understand that we did not understand each other. For example, when some of the group members tried to ask another group member to upload their changes to the css document in a very nice manner – thereby stating this as a general statement that “everyone should merge their files”, the person it concerned didn’t understand that he/she was the one people were waiting for. The design vs. functionality-debate has also been strong with this group.</p>

     <p><strong>Lack of leadership.</strong> We did not elect a leader of the project. Reflecting upon this choice and the overall project experience, it might have been a wiser choice to elect a leader. As everyone struggled to keep up with the internal deadlines, nobody wanted to raise to the occasion to get a clear status on the project. Also, we tried to implement several cooperation tools such as Trello, but this page was abandoned after a couple of days, and it was hard to know what other people were doing. Overall, it would have been preferable that someone made sure that we kept on track with everything, that we were on the same page, etc, and that this person would have less coding responsibility as project management takes time.</p>

     <p>Of course, there were also many positive learning experiences in this project. It was very interesting for everyone to work together across disciplines – the communication branch learnt more about how to cooperate with the IT branch, and vice versa. We think this will be a valuable experience in work life. Taking everything into account: Gløshaugen branch and Dragvoll branch successfully merged.</p>  

     <h3>Henrik</h3>
     <p>As the <em>one</em> person on this group without a bachelor's degree already, I will say I learned a lot about group-work, working in a semi-professional setting, and adjusting to the knowledge (or the lack thereof, especially related to Git) of other group members. I feel that we should have had someone responsible for holding our internal deadlines, so we could have do it more timely, and deliverered ahead of the deadline. Otherwise we had a great mood in the meetings, and I will try to implement the obligatory snacks in later settings.</p>

     <p>I also feel like there was a slight mismatch in terms of how we work, for example when writing this exact document I am typing straight into VS Code, while the rest have a Google Doc on Drive, and I should have done a better job of understanding and getting the same idea of how we wanted the website to look like, with an example being that there exists a mockup for one of the pages I had the responsibility for, but I did not know it existed, because someone forgot to include it in P2_design_13.html, so next time I will make sure to stay more up to date with the common idea. ☭</p>
