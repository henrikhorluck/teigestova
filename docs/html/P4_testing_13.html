      <h3>Testing platforms</h3>
      <p>The website was tested mainly on laptops, with both macOS and Windows. With Google Chrome and Safari on macOS, and Chrome and Firefox on Windows. We tested on mobiles as well, with a majority of iPhones, but one test-participant answered he/she used Android and Safari, which doesn't make sense.</p>

     <h3>Our response</h3>
     <dl>
       <dt><strong>Old-feeling Design</strong></dt>
       <dd>There were several responses regarding the design 'feeling' old, but those were from a younger audience that those we are aiming for, and therefore feel that the design is appropiate. After the class we could also change the design to be "fancier" or more animated and so on, but we do not have time to do changes like that right now.</dd>
       <dt><strong>Other design wishes</strong></dt>
       <dd>There were other design-issues regarding things like boring fonts and irresponsive images. We have a prototype with changed fonts, and will try to incorporate as soon as possible. The images not working is also a CSS-issue and should be fixed. A lot of the design issues have come from us having many different forms of css and issues related to merging them, and thus it would make sense to do a complete CSS-makeover ðŸ’…, which will happen, eventually.</dd>
       <dt><strong>Issues</strong></dt>
       <dd>At the time of testing there were several bugs/issues with the navigation bar, which is a functional problem, and will be fixed with the addition of a `position: absolute` somewhere.</dd>
       <dt><strong>Slow loading</strong></dt>
       <dd>The was one response complaining about slow loading, which we can fix partly by making sure only the appropiate size image is downloaded, or compress the images, but it might also be an issue related to folk.ntnu, which would make it far harder to fix.</dd>
       <dt><strong>Minor usability</strong></dt>
       <dd>Making the anchor tags more clear that they are clickable should be fixed with something like `a {text-decoration: underline;}`, but then we need to make sure that matches with our current design. </dd>
       <dt><strong>Link to ourDogsParent instead of image view on teigestova.html</strong></dt>
       <dd>While that would probably make more sense in terms of website design, imageView.js is a part of the javascript requirement on this project, but could be moved and implemented on for example ourDogsPuppies.html once the project is finished and we have actual puppies to promote.</dd>
