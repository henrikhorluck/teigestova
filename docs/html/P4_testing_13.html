      <h3>Testing platforms</h3>
      <p>The website was tested mainly on laptops, with both macOS and Windows. With Google Chrome and Safari on macOS, and Chrome and Firefox on Windows. We tested on mobiles as well, with a majority of iPhones, but one test-participant answered he/she used Android and Safari, which doesn't make sense.</p>

     <h3>Our response</h3>
     <dl>
       <dt><strong>Old-feeling Design</strong></dt>
       <dd>There were several responses regarding the design 'feeling' old, but those were from a younger audience that those we are aiming for, and therefore feel that the design is appropiate. After the class we could also change the design to be "fancier" or more animated and so on, but we do not have time to do changes like that right now.</dd>
       <dt><strong>Other design wishes</strong></dt>
       <dd>There were other design-issues regarding things like boring fonts and irresponsive images. We have a prototype with changed fonts, and will try to incorporate as soon as possible. The images not working is also a CSS-issue and should be fixed. A lot of the design issues have come from us having many different forms of css and issues related to merging them, and thus it would make sense to do a complete CSS-makeover üíÖ, which will happen, eventually.</dd>
       <dt><strong>Issues</strong></dt>
       <dd>At the time of testing there were several bugs/issues with the navigation bar, which is a functional problem, and will be fixed with the addition of a `position: absolute` somewhere.</dd>
       <dt><strong>Slow loading</strong></dt>
       <dd>The was one response complaining about slow loading, which we can fix partly by making sure only the appropiate size image is downloaded, or compress the images, but it might also be an issue related to folk.ntnu, which would make it far harder to fix.</dd>
       <dt><strong>Minor usability</strong></dt>
       <dd>Making the anchor tags more clear that they are clickable should be fixed with something like `a {text-decoration: underline;}`, but then we need to make sure that matches with our current design. </dd>
       <dt><strong>Link to ourDogsParent instead of image view on teigestova.html</strong></dt>
       <dd>While that would probably make more sense in terms of website design, imageView.js is a part of the javascript requirement on this project, but could be moved and implemented on for example ourDogsPuppies.html once the project is finished and we have actual puppies to promote.</dd>

     <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
     <p> During this project, we have learnt a lot about cooperating offline and online. Some groupware systems worked well from the get-go and will definitely be used in other projects (Slack), others, we have struggled with ‚Äì and understand that we should create project specific guidelines for how these should be used. These are some of the key learning take-aways from this project (outside of HTML, CSS and JavaScript):</p>

     <p><strong>Lost in merging.</strong> Unfortunately, not everyone were able to go to a Git course or grasp the functionality well enough, and this lead to some difficulties. Firstly, everybody worked internally on their CSS document for a long amount of time without uploading it to git and see how the documents worked together. We first merged our five separate CSS documents five days before the P3 and P4 deadline. This lead to merge conflicts, and the group‚Äôs most Git proficient members had a hard time merging the documents. In the effort, several lines of styling disappeared, and the css code some of the less css-skilled group members had worked hard to deploy. As a consequence, the same styling had to be implemented again by the responsible for the main CSS document, and some group members lost some of their motivation to style their respective pages.</p> 

     <p><strong>Lost in translation.</strong> There were also some issues with understandment. This has been a multi-disciplinary working group with different perspectives on the importance of different elements, different cooperation styles, and different use of expressions. We did not always understand each other ‚Äì and, more importantly ‚Äì we did not always understand that we did not understand each other. For example, when some of the group members tried to ask another group member to upload their changes to the css document in a very nice manner ‚Äì thereby stating this as a general statement that ‚Äúeveryone should merge their files‚Äù, the person it concerned didn‚Äôt understand that he/she was the one people were waiting for. The design vs. functionality-debate has also been strong with this group.</p>

     <p><strong>Lack of leadership.</strong> We did not elect a leader of the project. Reflecting upon this choice and the overall project experience, it might have been a wiser choice to elect a leader. As everyone struggled to keep up with the internal deadlines, nobody wanted to raise to the occasion to get a clear status on the project. Also, we tried to implement several cooperation tools such as Trello, but this page was abandoned after a couple of days, and it was hard to know what other people were doing. Overall, it would have been preferable that someone made sure that we kept on track with everything, that we were on the same page, etc, and that this person would have less coding responsibility as project management takes time.</p>

     <p>Of course, there were also many positive learning experiences in this project. It was very interesting for everyone to work together across disciplines ‚Äì the communication branch learnt more about how to cooperate with the IT branch, and vice versa. We think this will be a valuable experience in work life. Taking everything into account: Gl√∏shaugen branch and Dragvoll branch successfully merged.</p>
